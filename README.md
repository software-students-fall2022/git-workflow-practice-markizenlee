# How I Feel About It
This article explains clearly what agile software development is, which is pretty similar to the incremental model we talked about in class. The developers are supposed to break the project up into several iterations, while in each iteration they implement certain core features, which makes the project up-and-running with even the simplist functions at the end of each iteration. This method adapts itself to changes quickly and facilitates deployment.
